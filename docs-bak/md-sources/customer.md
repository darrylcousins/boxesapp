## Emails

When a subscription order is created the customer will receive 3 emails.

1. From Shopify detailing the current order.
2. From Recharge advising the customer of the creation of the box subscription
   and other subscriptions for the add on items.
3. From Boxes detailing the box and items in the box.

## Editing

In between orders the customer may edit the items in their box. This will be
dependent on the products included in the upcoming box. As can be seen below a
clear indication is given for the changes necessary to match the upcoming box.

A charge is processed and a new order is created by Recharge 3 days prior to
the scheduled delivery date, after which time the box cannot be edited. Three
days prior to the order being created a `charge upcoming` email is sent to the
customer by Boxes, at this time the necessary changes are automatically made to
the customers box (unavailable extras removed etc) in the same manner as shown
below. Between the charge upcoming and the charge processed (i.e. order
created) the customer has the opportunity to make changes to their box.

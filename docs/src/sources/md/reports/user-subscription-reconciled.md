### Reconcile Subscription

A user reconciles a box subscription. When the use loads box subscription
interface and the current box items do not match with the next scheduled box
then they are obliged to click the "reconcile to continue" button which will
reconcile their subscription with the upcoming box. The algorithms to do so
match the actions that happen when the `charge/upcoming` webhook is received.
